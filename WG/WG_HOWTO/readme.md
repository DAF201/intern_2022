# Just for whoever pick up my remaining after I leave

##### #Just a pre-warning, don't use any function looks extremely complex, those were left by whoever before me. I made new functions, but I didn't remove those old stuffs cause there are tons of them already there, and if I just delete them likely the whole thing will crush.

##### #Also, don't fking write something like wgg_data1,wgg_data2...balabala, no one else can understant the purpose of those shit

##### #Lastly, don't make function of every single button/switch, that is stupid indeed. There are already tons of them left in this project before I took over this project
